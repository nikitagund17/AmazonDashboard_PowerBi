âœ… Power BI Report: The heart of our data analysis, providing insights into our Amazon sales, customer behavior, and growth trends.

âœ… Data Sources: The datasets used to create the report, which can be updated for real-time analysis.

ðŸ“Š Why this matters:

ðŸ’¡ Data-driven decision-making is the key to our success on Amazon. With this dashboard, we can monitor our performance, identify trends, and make informed business decisions.
